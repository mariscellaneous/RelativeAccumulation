Description of csv columns

Latitude: Latitude of airborne snow radar pick location
Longitude: Longitude of airborne snow radar pick location 

Absolute_Accumulation_Rate: Accumulation rates as derived from NASA Operation IceBridge snow radar and forced to MERRA-2 P-E on MERRA-2's gridscale. Please note this product is heavily dependent on MERRA-2 P-E.

Relative_Accumulation: Absolute accumulation rate at a radar pick divided by a 25 km mean absolute accumulation rate. This is analagous to  cumulative mass divided by 25 km mean cumulative mass. Can be used to study small-scale variability in accumulation rate, but will not provide absolute accumulation rates in m w.e./yr. It is largely independent of MERRA-2 P-E. 
Relative_Accumulation_Error: Error in relative accumulation as described in Supplement S1. 

Further description of accumulation rates to be found in paper submitted for publication.
